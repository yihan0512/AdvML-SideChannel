class SimpleSerialTemplate:

    """
    SimpleSerial serial reader base class.

    All SimpleSerial readers have two data buffers:
    1. A buffer for received data to go to the SimpleSerial target module. This buffer contains bytes.
    2. A buffer for sent and received data to go to the serial terminal. This buffer contains ['in'/'out', char] pairs.
    These two structures are queues with a fixed maximum size: when they overflow, the oldest data must be removed
    from the queues.

    Note that child classes should only need to implement the following:
    - hw_read()
    - hw_write()
    - hw_in_waiting()
