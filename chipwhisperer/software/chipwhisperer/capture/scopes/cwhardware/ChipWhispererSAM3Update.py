    Despite the name of the file, this will work with the Lite, the Pro, and
    the Nano. If the ChipWhisperer has already been erased, pass None instead
    of the scope object and skip the enter_bootloader() call.

    Example:

     #. Attach the scope part of the hardware to your computer.

     #. Connect to the scope using::

            import chipwhisperer as cw

            # For the ChipWhisperer Nano
            scope = cw.scope(scope_type=cw.scopes.CWNano)

     #. Place the hardware in bootloader mode using::

            # use created scope object from previous step
            programmer = cw.SAMFWLoader(scope=scope)

            # and make it unusable until reprogrammed.

     #. Unplug then plug in the hardware into your computer again.
        The device should be shown as BOSSA in the device manager
        on Windows. Make not of the port number the BOSSA device
        is attached to (for example: COM1, or COM2, and so on)

     #. Program the SAM3U with::

            import chipwhisperer as cw
            programmer = cw.SAMFWLoader(scope=None)

        On linux instead of 'COM#' use the linux equivalent to a port
        'ttyASM#' or equivalent.
