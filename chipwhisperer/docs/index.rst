Welcome to the new home of the documentation for the ChipWhisperer software,
following the release of ChipWhisperer 5.1.0.

After :ref:`installing <install>` ChipWhisperer and setting up your
`hardware`_ run:

.. code:: python

    >>> import chipwhisperer as cw
    >>> scope = cw.scope()
    >>> scope
    cwlite Device
    gain =
        mode = low
        gain = 0
        db   = -6.5
    adc =
        state      = False
        basic_mode = low
        timeout    = 2
        offset     = 0
    ...


You now have access to an object-oriented interface to configure the attached
hardware. To see what is possible with this interface check out the
:ref:`scope section <api-scope>` of the API documentation.

To see longer, more in-depth examples of what the tool-chain can do, take a look
at the `Using the ChipWhisperer Analyzer for a Correlation Power Analysis Attack <tutorial-pa_cpa_1-openadc-cwlitearm>`_
tutorial. Check out all the other :ref:`tutorials <tutorials>` to see what is possible. The
content is generated from Jupyter notebooks included with the project. It
includes interactive plots.

If you are new to the latest major changes and other websites and resources
related to side-channel analysis and the ChipWhisperer tool-chain, here is an
:ref:`overview <getting_started>` page for you.
