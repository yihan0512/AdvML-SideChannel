You may also want to try glitching some of the other functions in `glitchsimple.c`. If you have a Raspberry Pi, you can also attempt the attack described [here](https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_A3_VCC_Glitch_Attacks#Glitching_More_Advanced_Targets:_Raspberry_Pi) (though you'll need to transfer the steps from the old GUI over to Jupyter)."
